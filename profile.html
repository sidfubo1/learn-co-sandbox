      <p>One Piece (Japanese: ワンピース Hepburn: Wan Pīsu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since July 22, 1997, and has been collected in 89 tankōbon volumes. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's ultimate treasure known as "One Piece" in order to become the next Pirate King.</p>
      <p>The manga has been adapted into an original video animation (OVA) produced by Production I.G in 1998, and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed thirteen animated feature films, one OVA and eleven television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.</p>

      <p>The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the famed treasure One Piece and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わら海賊団篇 Mugiwara Kaizoku-danhen), Luffy rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a liar; and Sanji, a womanizing chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including the doctor and anthropomorphized reindeer Tony Tony Chopper, the archaeologist and former assassin Nico Robin, the cyborg shipwright Franky, the skeletal musician Brook, and the fishman helmsman Jimbei, and they also acquire a new ship named Thousand Sunny.</p>
      <p>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races such as "fishmen" (a race of fish/human hybrids, similar to mermen and mermaids), dwarves, Minkmen (a race of humanoid animals), and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line (赤い土の大陸 レッドライン Reddo Rain), which is also the only continent in the world.[2] The Grand Line (偉大なる航路 グランドライン Gurando Rain), a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue (北の海 ノースブルー Nōsu Burū), East Blue (東の海 イーストブルー Īsuto Burū), West Blue (西の海 ウェストブルー Uesuto Burū) and South Blue (南の海 サウスブルー Sausu Burū).[3] Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts (凪の帯 カームベルト kāmu beruto), similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings (海王類 kaiōrui, lit. "sea kings"). Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line.[4] However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone (海楼石 kairōseki) to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain (リヴァース・マウンテン Rivāsu Maunten).[5] Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line.[6] The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World (新世界 Shin Sekai).[7]</p>
